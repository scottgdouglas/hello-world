# hello-world
My name is Scott and I am learning how to make branches on GitHub so that I can take part in a Codeacademy course.
Despite the advice given in the tutorial, sadly I've never that the good fortune to taste moon tacos.
I have not got a clue what is happening here. I can' even get the basic right.
FFS - why does this seem so difficult?
